# Angel-Cards
Application to randomly select an Angel Card. 

## TODO: 

### BUGS

- AUTO LAYOUT - CRITICAL -> diff size phones break
    - Right now we are limiting to portrait only
    - The issue is that the image gets resized when we create the vertical stack view
- allow to flip back to the back
- randomize pictures from assets dynamically
    
### Upgrades

- Add flip animation  
- See More button to puil up additional text
- Sounds test
- Other special effects 

### Features
- Allow a view where user can select from mutliple cards and then select from that 
- Add autolayout
